Arithmetic Progression

    2,4,6,8,10.......
    let's assume the first term is "a"
    and the difference is "d"
    1st => a
    2nd => a+d
    3rd => a+2n
    .
    .
    .
    .
    nth => a+(n-1)d

    Also, sum = n/2 * (2*a + (n-1)*d)


Geometric Pregression

    2,4,8,16.......
    let's assume the first term is "a"
    and the ration is "r"
    1st => a
    2nd => a*r
    3rd => a*r^2
    .
    .
    .
    .
    nth => a*r^(n-1)

    Also, sum = (a*(1-r)^n)/(1-r)
